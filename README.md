# Youtube Trends

This is a very basic python library. It makes you compare up to 1000 keywords at the same time in the last 24 hours on youtube. The most searched keyword is always is given a score of 100. Note that having a score of 100 does not mean that the keyword is the best, it only means that it is the best keyword compared to the other input keywords.

Note that if you exceed some limit the requests will fail, you will have to reboot your router. That's because Google has blocked your IP address and you can no more access to the data. A proxy function will be implemented on the future.
